# End of .gitignore
# This .gitignore file is designed to ignore common files and directories
# that should not be tracked in a Python project, including virtual environments,
# Python bytecode files, IDE configurations, OS-specific files, logs, and testing artifacts.
# It also includes a section for environment variables, which should not be committed
# to version control for security reasons.
# Make sure to customize the .env.example file with your actual environment variables
# and keep it in sync with your project's requirements.
