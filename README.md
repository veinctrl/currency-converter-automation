Description: A Python-based automated currency conversion tool that demonstrates API integration, error handling, comprehensive testing, and software engineering best practices.

Features

Real-time currency conversion using live exchange rates
Support for 150+ currencies
Intelligent caching mechanism to reduce API calls
Comprehensive error handling and logging
Command-line interface (coming soon)
100% test coverage with 14 unit tests
Security-focused design with input validation
Clean, documented code following PEP 8 standards

Technologies Used

Python 3.8+
requests - API integration
python-dotenv - Environment management
pytest - Testing framework
unittest.mock - Test mocking
logging - Comprehensive logging system

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Git

Installation

Clone the repository:

clone https://github.com/yourusername/currency-converter-automation.git
cd currency-converter-automation

Create a virtual environment:

bash# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables (optional):

bash# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API key if you have one (not required for basic functionality)
ðŸ’» Usage
Basic Usage
pythonfrom currency_converter import CurrencyConverter

# Create converter instance
converter = CurrencyConverter()

# Convert currency
result = converter.convert(100, "USD", "EUR")
print(f"100 USD = {result} EUR")
Command Line Usage
bashpython currency_converter.py
Example Output
Currency Converter Automation Script
========================================
100 USD = 85.0 EUR
50 GBP = 6325.0 JPY
1000 EUR = 1176.47 USD

Supported currencies:
USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY, SEK, NZD...
ðŸ§ª Testing
This project includes comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage of core functionality.
Running Tests

Security Features
As this project is part of my cybersecurity portfolio, it implements several security best practices:

Environment Variables: API keys are never hardcoded
Input Validation: All currency codes and amounts are validated
Error Handling: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues
Logging: Comprehensive audit trail for all operations
Rate Limiting: Cache implementation reduces API calls and prevents abuse

Future Enhancements

 Add CLI with argparse for interactive use
 Implement Flask REST API
 Add cryptocurrency support
 Create GUI interface using Tkinter
 Add historical exchange rate tracking
 Implement rate limiting and request queuing
 Add Docker containerization
 Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
 Implement API key rotation system
 Add support for offline mode with cached rates
